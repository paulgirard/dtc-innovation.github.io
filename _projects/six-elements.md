We **design and prototype** open hardware sensors and web applications to help recycling centers to scale and anticipate their waste collection logistics.

Ultimately we empower users by **recommending specialised collection venues**, either recycling centers, charities, DIY labs or tailored upcycling shops which would give a second life to non-working objects.

### User Estimation Sensors

We design and deploy **Wi-Fi data collection sensors** in recycling centers to estimate the number of people coming in and out as well as their queuing time.

The data are anonymously collected and munged together to indicate on a web application the **busyness of any of the equiped recycling centers**.

### Recycling Centers Dashboard

The sensors are equiped with an **embedded touch screen** to let the recycling centers agents **manage the filling state of each container**. It enable them to save time and improve the logistics of the container collection.
