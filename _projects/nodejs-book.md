We **design and author** a programming book about the **Node.js platform** with France's #1 programming publishing house [Eyrolles][eyrolles].

We use this opportunity to rethink how authors, readers and editors interact together.

### Designing the Right Content

Writing technical content is useful only if it is useful and in line with readers expectations of the technical environment.

We travel through France during 3 months **to meet with developers** and get a **better understanding of their day to day practices** to tailor explainations and examples.

### An Open Documentation Approach

The book **content is made available during the writing process** to gather a community around it and **to collect feedbacks before** the book goes to press.

The daily standup hooks on people interests while **local meetups enable us to share** the knowledge and experience of a book writing experience is.

### Towards a Modern Web Publishing Toolchain

We got inspired by O'Reilley authors like [Axel Rauschmayer][rauschma] to move from the locked-in experience of Word or LibreOffice to embrace a **GitHub combined with the Asciidoctor toolchain**.

The **content is derived** to be distributed as a bookbound book, HTML website, eBook and even as an npm package.
