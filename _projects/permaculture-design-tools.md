We **observe and propose** a way to bind sustainable agriculture practices like **permaculture** and computers.

We don't want to introduce computers or robots on the field but rather to support humans on the field by **providing open knowledge and visibility**.

> This project has been pitched to the [Shuttleworth Foundation][shuttleworth] with the support of the London [Open Data Institute][odi]. Sadly, it did not go through.

### Plants and Seeds Database

Design **optimal datasets** shared in an open format. It is an open knowledge foundation of the following points.

### Contextual Crop Calendar

Crop calendars are manually created and updated by some farmers unions and independent initiatives.

There is a need to deconstruct existing material to gather varying requirements, to determine contextual datapoints such as geographical location and weather conditions.

This will provide a calendar framework to reproduce, to cover and to distribute over a broader geographical spectrum.

### Orchard and Vegetable Beds Visualiser

Many professionals draw their design plans by hand. The visualiser is a complementary tool **to plan the workweeks** and make it readable by non-experts.

1. User research to understand how farms design their plans and dispatch the work;
2. Develop a prototype;
3. Iterate over weekly feedbacks and interviews (readability, helpfulness…);
4. Scheduled email digests to farm staff.

### Vegetable Beds Designer

This is an extension of the beds visualiser to enable experts and non-experts **to design their own beds** (at farm, allotment and home scales).

We could possinly prototype a democratic web or Excel interface with the following features: calendar export, timeline simulation, crop pairing.
