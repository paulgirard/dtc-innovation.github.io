We design and deliver **web development courses** in partnership with [Beyond Broadcasting][bb] and [BBC Media Action][bbcma].

Training is based on **hands-on exercises** tailored for an audience with a **broad range of skills**, from video editors to programmers and journalists.

### Front-end web development course

Frontend skills are brought to the trainees by **turning a real world graphic design** into **HTML and CSS components**.

Trainees get to learn about the following elements:

* CSS frameworks;
* content encoding;
* responsive webdesign;
* HTML and CSS 101.

### Website Development

The **Model/View/Presenter paradigm** is brought to the trainees by integrating their HTML and CSS into a **static website generator**. Knowledge is then applied to a dynamic framework (like _Laravel_) to illustrate the same concepts with a programming language and a database server.

Trainees get to learn about the following elements:

* code collaboration with git branching model;
* templating a data-driven website;
* evaluating and addressing web performance.

### Designing a Living Styleguide

Designers and developers are brought together to create **reusable visual components** via a **living styleguide**. HTML and CSS components are abstracted into self-documented templates which can then be reused in any projects.

Trainees get to learn about the following elements:

* visual language and how to design one;
* state of the art of living styleguides;
* building our own styleguide with a static website generator;
* managing SVG assets.
